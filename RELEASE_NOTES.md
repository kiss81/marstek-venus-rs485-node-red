## 0.2.4
- Patch: Improve derivative term and bumpless operation logic in control flow
    - The derivative term now takes the derivative of the (input) smoothed error.
        - This allows for more aggressive D-term tuning at higher input smoothing levels.
        - This combats oscillations and overshoot, without causing runaways because of noise amplification (which is smoothed out at 50% and higher levels).
    - Implementation result: changed the "Bumpless operation - changing target grid consumption" group:
        - Added logic to distinguish between setpoint changes and steady-state, using a new switch node.
        - Added a function to calculate the derivative of the error when the setpoint changes, and another for the process variable otherwise.
    - Changed files: node-red/control-flow.json, RELEASE_NOTES.md


## 0.2.3
- Refactor: Modularize Home Assistant configuration using directory-based includes for input numbers, input selects, and template sensors.
- Split configuration into separate files for easier management and extension.
- Update Node-RED batteries flow with new group, node positions, and linking instructions.
- Clarify and expand Copilot instructions for commit workflow.

## 0.2.2
- Feat: Add gain scheduling and stability monitoring to control flow.
    - Implement gain scheduling logic for PID controller, including master gain switching based on standard deviation and disturbance detection.
    - Add stability monitoring nodes and debug outputs for rapid loss/regaining of control.
    - Refine battery charge limiting thresholds and update function logic.
    - Rename and reorganize groups and nodes for clarity.
    - Changed file: node-red/control-flow.json

## 0.2.1
- Node-RED control flow: Added output filtering, error signal dampening, and deviation analytics nodes.
- Home Assistant: Updated dashboard and expanded input_numbers.yaml with PID tuning, dampening, and analytics controls for improved battery management.

## 0.2.0
- Major improvement: Split the all-in-one Node-RED flow into three separate flows (`batteries-flow.json`, `control-flow.json`, `master-switch-flow.json`).
- This allows the PID-control flow to be updated independently, without affecting user battery configurations.
