# Home Battery Control via Home Assistant & Node-RED

Comment kiss81: this fork is a proof of concept for a multi battery setup that uses the marstek CT PID anti-feed mode in "full control mode" instead of forcing the batteries in rs485 mode and forcing power updates. The rationale behind this is that it might damage your marstek flash memory because of having so many "forced power" updates. 
This version works the same as gitcodebob version, but for now you need to set the PID to: Kp = 1, Ki = 0, Kd = 0, input smoothing / output smoothing to your liking. (high output smoothing prevents additional batteries to be switched into anti-feed during short peak currents) 
To use / switch from Bob's version:all-flows-in-one-file.jsonz
1) import the all-flows-in-one-file.json in node red
2) replace the packages/house_battery_control_config.yaml
3) update your dashboard in home assistant to use the stub for stop / charge / discharge. Easiest to go to your dashboard and edit in raw mode and just replace the 4 entities in the "Your energy and battery usage" section. Alternatively you can just reimport the dashboard.yaml

Home Battery Control is an open-source solution for the community to control home batteries and electric vehicles using Home Assistant and Node-RED. Control your batteries exactly how you want, all in one place without vendor lock-ins.

This project is designed for hobbyists who want full control over their home battery systems. It provides ready-to-use flows and configuration examples, including a PID controller for advanced battery management. Use at your own discretion.

## Features
- **You don't need to be a programmer**
- **Node-RED Control Flows:** Easy to import and use control flows for battery charge/discharge ([node-red/](node-red/))
- **Home Assistant Integration:** Premade dashboard for onboarding and control. Example configuration files included. ([home assistant/](home%20assistant/))
- **Customizable:** Tweakers? Adapt the flows and configuration to your specific battery hardware and automation needs
- **Multiple Strategies:** [Self-consumption](docs/04-setup-self-consumption.md) (use your own energy), [Timed](node-red/02%20strategy-timed.json), [Dynamic](docs/05-setup-dynamic.md) (price-based), [Charge](node-red/02%20strategy-charge.json), [Sell](node-red/02%20strategy-sell.json), [Charge PV](node-red/02%20strategy-charge-pv.json) (solar-only), [Full Stop](node-red/02%20strategy-full-stop.json). Easily add your own. See [all strategies](docs/03-strategies.md).
- **Easy Updates:** Grab the latest control flow without losing your personal configurations

### Installation Summary
1. **Connect your batteries to HA** - e.g. use ESPhome or LilyGo to connect batteries to Home Assistant (see [Modbus setup guide](docs/02-modbus-setup.md))
1. **Install Node-RED** - [Install in Home Assistant](https://zachowj.github.io/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket/guide/installation.html)
1. **Clone this repository** - `git clone https://github.com/gitcodebob/marstek-venus-rs485-node-red.git`
1. **Configure Home Assistant** - Import YAML files from `home assistant/` folder
1. **Import Node-RED flows** - Import control flows from `node-red/` folder
1. **Set up strategies** - Choose and configure your preferred control strategy

📖 **[Complete Getting Started Guide](docs/01-getting-started.md)**

### Safety First
> **Disclaimer:** You are responsible for configuring and operating your system safely. Monitor carefully. Be prepared to switch off battery control or disengage physically.

- The P1 value is expected in Watt (W). If your meter supplies kW, multiply the P1 input × 1000
- **Test your first setup in 800W mode**
- Set appropriate Max. Charge and Max. Discharge values for each battery via the dashboard
- Always consult a professional electrician when going above 800W
